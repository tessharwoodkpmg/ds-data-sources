# Transport Data Sources

## Introduction & Notes

A repo for us to log and share all of our good data sources relating to Transport. This isn't intended to be a complete and exhaustive list of datasets or the variables contained within them, but instead a rough and ready guide to aid people working in transport data in their search for appropriate data. This collection has a UK focus but interesting non-UK datasets may also be included.

This repo is the sister of our [Data Science Learning Resources Repo](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/ds-learning-resources) so feel free to check that out also.

This is intended to be open source! Feel free to [contribute to it](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) with your own data or data you know of.

### Rules & Conventions for updating:

1. Only include datasets, not statistics, reports, visualisations etc.
2. Only include datasets that might be of interest to people working in transport.
3. Include a source. 
4. Include details of the key variables within each dataset. This helps with searching.
5. Include dates / backseries availability wherever possible.
6. Include the format of the data (e.g. xlsx, csv, API etc.).
7. If the data is in API format also include the API reference, registration, guides, tutorials or links to helpful packages / sample code.
8. Indicate if the dataset(s) is a one-off, discontinued or no longer kept up to date.
9. If the data isn't free or requires a subscription / payment at some point, indicate this in the link.
10. If possibile indicate what region the data is for (e.g. UK, England, London, West Midlands etc.) etc. In future it may be necessary to split the data by national and regional level data.

## General Data Sources

* [NOMIS Labour Force Query Tool](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/select/getdatasetbytheme.asp?opt=3&theme=&subgrp=) ONS ran site focused on official labour market data that lets you build customized queries on a range of datasets including Census (1981-2011), Benefits (from 1999), Population (from 1981), Employment (from 1981), Businesses (from 2010), Earnings (from 1997) and allows you to download these in .csv format.

## Geographic Data Sources

* [Doogal](https://www.doogal.co.uk/) Private but well maintained and updated website with a wealth of geographic data including addresses, postcodes, administrative areas, counties as well as useful map tools including lat/lon finder, distances, elevation and more in .csv format. Much of the data appears to be sourced from ONS and other official government sources.

## GIS Data Sources

## Transport Data Sources

### General / Multi-modal

* [DfT National Public Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN)](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/naptan) NaPTAN is Great Britain's national dataset of public transport access points (bus stops, rail stations, airports, ferry piers, tram/metro/underground stops).

They describe accessibility of public transport stations, stops and services. The data is not yet fully comprehensive, but does provide coverage across much of Great Britain. Note: Last updated 2013.

* [DfT National Public Transport Gazeteer (2011 - 2016)](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/nptg) NPTG is a database of localities (cities, towns, villages and other settlements) in Great Britain.

The DVLA is responsible for issuing driving licences in Great Britain (GB). Driving licences issued in Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Driver & Vehicle Agency and are outside the scope of this release.

* [Petrol & Diesel Prices (2009 - date)](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/c174a981-b0f2-4b39-adc0-1d0a27a7d8c9/petrol-and-diesel-prices) Weekly updated ataset produced by BEIS, showing petrol & diesel prices.

* [Traveline](https://www.travelinedata.org.uk/) Traveline provides journey planning and departure information covering Great Britain alongside timetable and real-time bus information. They are a not-for-profit governed by an executive board made up of representatives from transport operators, local authorities, and Passenger Focus. They hold the Traveline National Dataset (TNDS) of scheduled bus, tram, and light rail services, the NextBuses API providing live departures where available and scheduled departures where not, by stop and the National Operator Codes (NOC) database which gives national operator codes to reference transport operators.

* [Local Bus Service Registration (2014 - ?)](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/local-bus-service-registration) Register of all registered local bus services in Great Britain as recorded on the Operator Licensing Business System (OLBS) 

* [DfT National Coach Services (NCSD) (2013 - Date)](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/national-coach-services) The National Coach Services Database (NCSD) consists of schedule (timetable) data for several mainland UK coach services not contained in the Traveline National Dataset (TNDS).


* [AppyParking (API)](https://appyparking.com/develop/) APIs for on-street and off-street parking locations and petrol station prices and locations. The parking APIs appear to be free but the petrol station API appears to require a subscription.

### Rail

* [ORR Station Usage Stats (1997 - date)](http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates) Train station usage dataset in xlsx format compiled by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) for 1997 - date. Contains data on entries, exits broken down by type as well as geographic data about the station itself as well as the tlc and nlc station identifiers to help with merging to other data. 

* [Doogal Station Usage Stats (1997 - date)](https://www.doogal.co.uk/UkStations.php) Train station usage dataset based upon the ORR Station usage dataset but more succinct and extra area level data (e.g. Rural / Urban classification) and a full timeseries.

* [National Rail Enquiries Data Feeds (API)](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/46391.aspx) Three separate datafeeds for National Rail data including Darwin (Realtime train running data), Knowledgebase (including data on station facilities, service disruption, and engineering work) and Online Journey Planner (engine used to plan routes, calculate fares and establish ticket availability). Note that Darwin is a SOAP API, but [Huxley](https://github.com/jpsingleton/Huxley), allows easier access to this data. NRE don't provide much documentation however there is information available at the [Open Rail Data Wiki ](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/Main_Page).

* [Network Rail Open Data Feeds](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/who-we-are/transparency-and-ethics/transparency/open-data-feeds/) A variety of APIs including UK train planning data, location reference, train movements (in real time), train positioning, real time performance, schedule, speed restrictions, Very Short Term Plan (VSTP) and infrastructure.  The API requires registration and to manage expectations there is a waiting list and it's likely to take you a few months for your registration to be approved.

* [Rail Delivery Group Fares & Timetables](http://data.atoc.org/data-download) Datasets for UK train timetables, fares and London Terminal stations 'refreshed on an infrequent basis' and in a variety of formats including XML and CIF formats. The feeds are free but require registration.

The files are zipped and contain multiple JSON arrays so unpacking is required. The dataset contains information on departures, arrivals, delays etc. and is quite complex to decipher.


### Bus

* [Bus Open Data Service] (https://data.bus-data.dft.gov.uk/) Datasets in XML standards for England's bus timetables, live location, and fares. As well as cross boarder services with Scotland & Wales. Timetables are provided in TransXChange 2.4 PTI 1.1A (https://pti.org.uk/system/files/files/TransXChange_UK_PTI_Profile_v1.1.A.pdf) or GTFS.

Fares are provided in UK NeTEX (http://netex.uk/netex/schema.htm). Expected future features (delivery dates not yet available) - Punctuality data and Disruptions (Siri-SX & GTFS).

* [Traveline National Dataset (TNDS)](https://www.travelinedata.org.uk/traveline-open-data/traveline-national-dataset/) Public transport timetables for bus, light rail, tram and ferry services in Great Britain. Data is provided in [TransXChange](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/transxchange) XML format.
